# DECISION TREE SERVICE

## Overview

This is a Go file that implements a service with RabbitMQ integration and provides functionality related to user management. The service connects to RabbitMQ, declares a queue, and consumes messages from the queue. It also loads a configuration file and initializes a UserAPI component.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, make sure you have the following components set up:

- RabbitMQ: Ensure that RabbitMQ is running and accessible at amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/.
- Configuration File: Prepare a JSON configuration file containing the necessary settings for the service.

## Installation

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Install Go: Make sure you have Go installed on your system.
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it.
3. Create a new Go module by running the command: go mod init <module-name>.
4. Create a new Go file, such as main.go, and copy the code provided into it.
5. Import the required packages by running the command: go mod tidy.
6. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command: go get -u github.com/streadway/amqp.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary packages in your Go code:

```go
import (
    "encoding/json"
    "io/ioutil"
    "os"
    "os/signal"
    "sync"
    "syscall"
    "time"

    "github.com/streadway/amqp"
)
```

2. Create an instance of the Service struct by calling the NewService function:

```go
service := NewService();
```

3. Load the configuration file by calling the LoadConfig method and providing the file path as an argument:

```go
err := service.LoadConfig("<config-filepath>")
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
```

4. Start the service by calling the Start method:

```go
service.Start()
```

5. To gracefully stop the service, call the Stop method:

```go
service.Stop()
```

6. If you need to wait for the service to finish processing, you can call the Wait method:

```go
service.Wait()
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the provided code:

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```go
package main

func main() {
    service := NewService()

    err := service.LoadConfig("config.json")
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }

    service.Start()

    // Wait for termination signal
    // ...

    service.Stop()
    service.Wait()
}
```

### Example 2: Custom Configuration File

```go
package main

func main() {
    service := NewService()

    err := service.LoadConfig("/path/to/custom-config.json")
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }

    service.Start()

    // Wait for termination signal
    // ...

    service.Stop()
    service.Wait()
}
```

### Example 3: Additional Logic

```go
package main

func main() {
    service := NewService()

    err := service.LoadConfig("config.json")
    if err != nil {
        // Handle error
    }

    // Perform additional setup or customization
    // ...

    service.Start()

    // Wait for termination signal
    // ...

    service.Stop()
    service.Wait()
}
```

## Details

### Structs

- serviceConfig: Represents the configuration structure for the service, including settings for RabbitMQ and UserAPI.
- Service: Represents the main service struct, containing various fields and methods for managing the service.
- Functions and Methods
- NewService(): Creates a new instance of the Service struct with default values.
- Start(): Starts the service, initializing RabbitMQ, handling termination signals, and starting the rolling process.
- Stop(): Stops the service by closing the RabbitMQ channel and connection and signaling the rolling process to stop.
- Wait(): Waits for the service to finish processing all tasks.
- LoadConfig(confFilepath string) error: Loads the configuration from a JSON file and updates the service's configuration accordingly.
- rabbitMQInit() error: Initializes the RabbitMQ connection, creates a channel, and declares a queue.
- rolling() error: Represents the rolling process that continuously consumes messages from the RabbitMQ queue, handles received messages, and performs rolling operations.
